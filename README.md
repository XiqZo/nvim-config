# nvim-config
I've until now been using and IDE with vim keybinds but encountered nvim recentely.
I decided to try make the change and thiis is my personal configuration file for nvim.
This will continue to get udpated as I learn more about nvim and configure it to my taste.

Feel free to use i, but I cannot quarantee that it will work out of the box for you
